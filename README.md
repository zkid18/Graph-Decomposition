## Decomposition of the graph

Throughot of this practice, I will show an examples of finding a path between two given vertices, searching for a cycle in a graph, topological sorting, 

## Graph Representatiob

In this practice I will operate only undirected graphs, that can be represented in that way

```
4 5
2 1
4 3
1 4
2 4
3 2
```

Such input will create an undirected graph with four vertices and five edges.
